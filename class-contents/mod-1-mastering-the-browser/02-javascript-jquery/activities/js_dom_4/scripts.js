/*
element.setAttribute(attribute, value) changes the attribute value of an HTML element

In <p id="myPara" class="centered">, id and class are attributes
In <img src="..." alt="...">, src and alt are attributes

E.g
var myImage = document.getElementById("profile_photo");
myElement.setAttribute("src", "https://placehold.it/200/200");

The above lines of code will set the src attribute on the <img> with the id profile_photo to https://placehold.it/200/200

myElement.src = "https://placehold.it/200/200"; would also do the same as myElement.setAttribute("src", "https://placehold.it/200/200");
