              Nelly was my instructor for a full stack development boot camp. I entered his class with minimal coding
              knowledge, and on the many occasions that I felt overwhelmed, discouraged and ready to quit, Nelly was by
              my side giving me encouragement and making sure I understood the material. Nelly is the most all-in,
              dedicated teacher I've ever had- he consistently went above and beyond for me. He was my tutor, my mentor
              and is now a lifelong friend. His passion for coding and life itself is so sincere, he truly is a bright
              light in this world. Thank you for everything Nelly!

              Those are the words I have seen Nelly live by everyday as a teacher. He did not just do the job of
              teaching us coding but helped us find it within ourselves on days when most of us almost gave up.
              Not only a great teacher but a gem of a human being who lives for others. His passion to help others makes
              him one of the best teachers I have come across in my life. He has the skill to teach complex subjects in
              a way that not only makes it easy to understand but also gives you the confidence of tackling it on your
              own. I can not recommend Nelly enough and believe that whoever gets him as a teacher should consider
              themselves as the lucky ones.
              Way to go Nelly!

              Nelly taught my Full Stack Bootcamp at UC Davis. The instruction I received was superb, Nelly has a way of
              breaking down complex material into much simpler steps. His commitment to making sure each and every
              student understood the difficult material was remarkable, often meeting students in off time for private
              tutoring. Nelly approaches everything in life with passion and drive. I can't recommend him highly enough.
              Easily the most committed teacher I have ever had as well as a simply phenomenal human.

              If you walk into a classroom and Nelly is your instructor, be aware that you're luckier than any person
              who
              has won the lottery!
              <br>
              <br />
              Nelly has passion, heart, and a way of teaching that "doesn't make you feel [dumb]" (quoting from another
              student of his). He puts in every effort to ensure his students learn and understand both the front-end
              and
              back-end portions of full-stack development.
              <br />
              <br />
              On several occasions, he met with me and my group (for many hours) for our projects to teach us how to use
              MySQL, Handlebars.js, React, rendering the proper code onto the page, and a refresh of how Git branches
              worked. He worked with me in my own project on using MongoDB, Mongoose, discussed plans and diagrams on
              how
              to approach React and Mongo on said project, and met with me several times on Zoom to code with me,
              remaining patient the entire time.
              <br />
              <br />
              Not only can he teach, he develops his own apps, as well - along with coding an app featuring a card game
              from his home country, he also coded and promoted (ie, drove to multiple cities to test it) an app for
              pick-up basketball (which made me slightly more interested in the sport)!
              <br />
              <br />
              It was an honor to be Nelly's student - I'm glad he took the leap and flew to California to teach the
              inaugural class of UC Davis Extension's Coding Boot Camp!
              <br />
              <br />
              Thanks, Nelly! :D

              I was one of Nelly's students. Nelly is an unrelenting powerhouse. I knew this from my first day in his

              this intensive 6 month coding program.
              <br />
              <br />
              He walked in and assumed his position a true teacher, someone who goes beyond using words to explain
              concepts. He lights up when he's helping others. Nelly is a leader and his energy electrifies the air
              around him. Anyone who walks into the same room as him will know that he is making an impact beyond
              measure.
              <br />
              <br />
              He brings more to the table than just knowledge. Nelly brings fiery determination to pull this world up by
              its bootstraps. He unrelentingly believes in his students and their futures. And I know this because he
              never failed to see us in our true potential.

              Nelly is an accomplished mentor, developer, and teacher. He has been instrumental in my progression as a

              team mate. This is because Nelly has overcame more adversity than a large portion of students he will
              encounter. He has cultivated a well of patience that extends to students as well as colleagues. Although
              patient he is one of the hardest working people that I have encountered in any field. This is seen in his
              work, his teaching, and how he approaches life in general. I really can not say enough great things about

              I am very happy to recommend Nelly as an instructor, coder, and person. Nelly is the kind of teacher that
              students hope to have. He comes to class every day with a boundless energy, infectious passion, and an
              engaging smile. Everyday, he puts the students first and foremost. In addition, he daily displayed his
              ability to code. He seemed to know that he had to keep working harder than the students to make sure they
              were best served, and that is just what he did. I have seen him work through React, Javascript, Node,
              HTML, CSS, Handlebars, Express, MySQL, MongoDB, and many others.

              Nelly is an amazing Instructor. I was his student for 3 months
              full time camp. I learned a lot from him. He's very knowledgeable.
              He had well thought deep answers to all of my questions and my
              classmates'. He is very patient and thorough when it comes to
              explaining complex material in a simplified way. He has a strong
              ability to keep his students engaged and interested in the
              material he teaches. It was very obvious he has a strong deep
              knowledge of the technologies he taught us and of the software
              development field in general. I worked closely with him during my
              projects and class work and could experience how talented he is.
              He has a very amiable presence and would be a great, valuable
              addition to any place/position he's in. I'm grateful to him for
              all the knowledge he gave me and the hours of help he offered me

              Google Doodles history starts on 1998/8/30 when Google's founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, designed
              the first Google Doodle to let Google users at the time that Larry and Sergey were at the Burning Man
              Festival, just in case the servers crashed :). Ever since, Google has been designing Google Doodles to
              celebrate different people and events through out history.
              <br /><br />
              Having always been intrigued by them, naturally, I built a web app that
