# Welcome to Longtail Fullstack Bootcamp

## Overview
This intensive, full-time course trains students to become web developers. We start with programming fundamentals and quickly level up to advanced concepts in JavaScript the same technologies that help power the world’s most popular products and services.

The languages you learn matters least. Programming is about abstractions and expressions: the mechanics of code are universal and exist in all modern languages. We teach Javascript because we love it and many companies around the world actively use it. Thinking that your choice of language matters — especially as a beginner — is like thinking that you can only write poetry in English. We teach Javascript and the Javascript ecosystem (which includes Node) but you are really learning how to think, how to break problems down, how to express yourself, how to abstract ideas, and how to work together. We just do that through Javascript.

## Goals
1. *Learn through action*: In each module, you’ll develop key skills that build upon one another through interactive labs, lectures, and close collaboration — shipping code and showcasing your expertise through comprehensive Portfolio Projects.

2. *Prepare for a new career*: Our unique rigorous, modern curriculum trains you to think and build like a seasoned developer. It will allow you to quickly and easily adapt to any development environment. We are focused on helping you land your first developer job.
